## research experience

### Point cloud segmentation network based on adaptive frequency domain

The network mainly inputs point cloud original  data, calculates the difference of normal  as the frequency, and calculates attention to weighted point feature  to achieve point cloud segmentation

## Project experience

These are some projects I have worked on

### Simulated sand table unmanned driving car

This project is based on Kalman filter to achieve IMU and UWB data fusion with an accuracy of centimeter level in indoor interference free conditions，Using the Open Source Framework ROS（Robot Operating System），Utilizing Hall sensors to return magnetic stripe data for decision-making and motion algorithms and And using RGBD cameras to create dense point cloud maps



### Xi'an Metro intelligent purging equipment project

1. Project overview: the robot arm equipped with AGV and the depth camera are used to intelligently purge the subway bottom parts
2. In this project, I do the central control dispatching, control the AGV trolley to the designated position, control the robot arm, use the rgbd camera to conduct point cloud modeling for the subway, display the point cloud, and select the parts at the front end to obtain the purge parts, use image recognition and point cloud registration to calculate the part position, and automatically plan the purge action for purging
3. Point cloud processing, filtering, registration, ROS, robot arm motion planning, three-dimensional transformation, three-dimensional reconstruction, two-dimensional recognition

## Open source projects and works

### Open source project

- [QT_car_animation]( https://github.com/sunjianwen7/QT-interface-synchronous-32-magnetic-car-animation ）: complete the project to visualize and synchronize the functions of the lower trolley
