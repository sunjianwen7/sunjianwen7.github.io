## Project experience



### Jilin University self driving car training project



1. The project mainly uses UWB positioning, IMU data, millimeter wave prediction, ultrasonic camera data fusion to realize automatic path planning and motion control

2. In this project, I provide UWB positioning algorithm and simple data fusion, and develop each sensor node to control the accuracy within + - 2cm

3. Mainly use ros2 directed graph UWB to locate Yolo recognition



### China Automobile Research Institute digital twin sand table project



1. The virtual project is made by unity3d, and the real project is detected by the magnetic stripe car

2. In this project, I mainly use the built models and components to meet the needs of Party A, such as traffic light control, car scene planning, simulation gate control in rainy days, virtual reality data synchronization, improvement of the algorithm of the lower car program, and new algorithm to improve the turning stability of the car

3. 32 embedded development unity C # digraph



### Xi'an Metro intelligent purging equipment project



1. Project overview: the robot arm equipped with AGV and the depth camera are used to intelligently purge the subway bottom parts

2. In this project, I do the central control dispatching, control the AGV trolley to the designated position, control the robot arm, use the rgbd camera to conduct point cloud modeling for the subway, display the point cloud, and select the parts at the front end to obtain the purge parts, use image recognition and point cloud registration to calculate the part position, and automatically plan the purge action for purging

3. Point cloud processing, filtering, registration, ROS, robot arm motion planning, three-dimensional transformation, three-dimensional reconstruction, two-dimensional recognition
